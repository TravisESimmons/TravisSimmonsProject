# Deliverable 2

This portion of the lab consists of the functioning Query page and the related BLL services.

> **Remember to [reference your issues](./Deliverable-1.md)** when committing your work through this deliverable.

## Query – Search/Filter & Display Results

> For details of what is to be on this page, consult your specific scenario.

On this page, the student must display multiple rows of data in an HTML table. All fields of the displayed entity must be used, unless otherwise specified in your scenario. You must provide appropriate links from this page to the CRUD page for editing related data on this page or adding new data.

You must implement pagination, with the page size being set to 10 to 25 rows per page (as appropriate for your scenario).

## Evaluation - *10%* – Scenario Number: ________

> ***NOTE:** Your code **must** compile. Solutions that do not compile will receive an automatic mark of zero (0).*
>
> If you are unable to get a portion of the assignment to compile, you should:
>
> - Comment out the non-compiling portion of code
> - Identify the non-compiling portion in the **Incomplete Requirements** heading, noting the item's
>   - File name (e.g.: "Account.cs")
>   - Line number(s)
>   - Compiler error number and general message

Your assignment will be marked based upon the following weights. See the [general rubric](./ReadMe.md#generalized-marking-rubric) for details.

| Weight | Deliverable/Requirement |
| ---- | --------- |
