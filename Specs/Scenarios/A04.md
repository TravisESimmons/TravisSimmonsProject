# A04: Program Courses

You must create two pages (Query and CRUD) based on the following database tables. You will create the entities by using reverse engineering.

![ERD for A04](./A04.png)

## Special NOTE:

When using the entity Program in variable declarations you **must** use the **fully qualified class name** as the datatype. Example: **MySystemName.Entities.Program** somepropertyname {get;set;}.  

Why? The web application project also has a class called Program. The system will get confused betweem the two if you do not use the fully qualified name.

## Query

> **ProgramCourses by Program** - Search with Tabular Results

Display the results of looking up ProgramCourses by Program. Ensure the drop-down has appropriate text as the first option to act as a prompt for the user. Follow the mock-up below as a guide to displaying the results. Remember to include pagination.

Each program line will contain a link to allow for record maintenance. This link will cause your CRUD page to appear. Add a separate New button to have your CRUD appear.

## CRUD

> **ProgramCourses** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Deactivate (Delete)

Note the following:

- `ProgramCourse` entries are **not** deleted. Rather than providing a "delete" button, inlude a "Deactivate" button and in the BLL method, change the `Active` flag to `false` and update the database for that entry.
- For entering the course number, use an `<input>` with a `<datalist>` showing the results from a search filter. The search filter should return courses matching the supplied partial name.

  

**Queries**

Program List

```csharp
_context.Programs
        .OrderBy(x => x.ProgramName)
```

ProgramCourses for Program 

```csharp
_context.ProgramCourses
        .Where(x => x.ProgramID == programid)
        .Select(x => new ProgramCourseList{
          ProgramCourseID = x.ProgramCourseID,
          CourseID = x.CourseID,
          CourseName = x.Course.CourseName,
          Required = x.Required,
          SectionLimit = x.SectionLimit,
          Credits = x.Course.Credits
        })
        .OrderBy(x => x.CoursemName)
```

Create a model class to hold the data. Place this class in a separate folder call Models. Name the class ProgramCourseList. The above query indicates the required auto-implemented properties.

```csharp
public class ProgramCourseList
{
    public int ProgramCourseID { get; set; }
    public string CourseID { get; set; }
    public string CourseName { get; set; }
    public bool Required { get; set; }
    public int SectionLimit { get; set; }
    public decimal Credits { get; set; }
}
```

ProgramCourse by ID

```csharp
_context.ProgramCourses
        .Where(x => x.ProgramCourseID == programcourseid)  
        .FirstOrDefault()
```

Courses for DataList

```csharp
_context.Courses
        .OrderBy(x => x.CourseName);
```
