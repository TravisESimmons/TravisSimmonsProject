# A14: Club Activities

You must create two pages (Query and CRUD) based on the following database tables. You will create the entities by using reverse engineering.

![ERD for A14](./A14.png)

## Query

> **ClubActivities by Date** - Search with Tabular Resuits

Display the results of looking up Club Activities starting on or after the supplied start date. Show the Club, Activity name and its date (see mock-up below). Display the club list in alphabetic order. The results will be displayed by start date. Restrict the date input control to accept only dates. Include pagination to limit the number of records displayed. 
 
Add a selection column to each row for use during your CRUD processing. This link willl cause your CRUD page to appear. 

- **Search Filter:**
  - Use a start date filter for main Club Activities lookup (find all activites for clubs since the start date):

## CRUD

> **ClubActivities** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Delete

Note the following:

- Only future ClubActivities can be created, updated or deleted.
- ClubActivities' `StartDate` will default to Today if no start date is given when the activity is created.
- ClubActivities will have a CampusVenue assigned unless it is off campus. A CampusVenues `Location` list can be obtained from the database. Off campus flag is off (False) and the location is null. 
- Off campus activities must be flagged on (true) and have a location.
- The active must be either a campus activity OR a off campus activity
