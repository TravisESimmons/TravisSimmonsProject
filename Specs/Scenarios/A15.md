## CRUD

> **Rentals** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Delete

- `MaxVacancy` is the legal number of individual allowed in the unit. Example, a 4 bedroom unit would allow up to 4 individuals in the unit. The monthly rent is for the unit regardless of the number of individuals renting the unit.
- Include a not-mapped property called `FullAddress` when creating the Address entity definition. This property will return a string containing the full address in the format `number street (unit)`. Only add the (unit) if the unit is not null. Examples `1001 14 Ave` or `12015 109 St (A215)`
- LandLord name and Rental type descriptions lists can be obtained from the database for used on the respective forms. 
- **Search Filter:**
  - Use the LandLord filter and Addresses belonging to the landlord for Rental maintenance
