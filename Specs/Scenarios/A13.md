## CRUD

> **StudentAddresses** - Single Item Create/Read/Update/Delete

- StudentAddresses are not to be physically deleted. StudentAddresses are in effect until the UntilDate has been set.
- Include a not-mapped property called FullAddress when creating the Address entity definition. This property will return a string containing the full address using the format `number street (unit)`. Only add the (unit) if the unit is not null. Examples `1001 14 Ave` or `12015 109 St (A215)`
- **Search Filter:**
  - Use Student firstname/lastname filter for main Student Residence lookup (find all address for a specific student):
